# Invoicing Solution

## Summary
Sheetgo’s invoicing solution helps you organize and track invoices from multiple suppliers. Invoices are received through many sources so it is easy to lose track of them. Therefore, it can be difficult to control all invoices when they are scattered all over the place. Additionally, not having all invoices in one organized place makes it difficult to separate the paid invoices from the yet to be paid invoices. Organizing this is very time-consuming!
With this new solution, organizing your invoices and supplier info has never been easier! Your invoices along with your suppliers will be stored together in one clear overview. You’ll be able to adjust the status of your paid/yet to be paid documents. When an invoice is paid, the supplier will be automatically notified through email!
